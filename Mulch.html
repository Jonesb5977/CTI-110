<h2>
Description of cost and things to think about
</h2>

<p>
To lay mulch first you have to start by thinking about the color<br>
Then you have to think about how thick you want it<br>
I prefere laying it really thick because the thicker the longer<br> 
it last. If you have it really thin then it for one<br> 
doesnt last but maybe a couple of months because it will get little <br>
holes and it looks really crappy. The thicker it is the less likely it is<br>
to get the holes like when its really thin. My price bases completly on<br>
two factors. I base it off materials(how thick you want it, how far you want to spread it<br>
how many truck loads it will take to do that much) and labor. one truck load is $40<br>
ifs its a small area sometimes i can make 1 truck load work but most od the time you<br>
need more than one truck load. Most of the yards i do mulching for takes atleast 4 trucks<br>
to make it look really good.
