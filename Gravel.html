<h2>
Cost and Things to think about 
</h2>

<p>
The first thing about laying gravel is you need to measure the area you are trying to<br>
lay it in. You want to get the area of it. Then you want to think about how thick<br> 
you want it. 1 ton is $40 just like the mulch is. <br>
<br>
The first thing that needs to happen is that you need to figure out a color you want <br>
Once you figure out the color then you need to think about where you want it. <br> 
Then you need to think about if you want decorative paving. Then you need to think about <br>
how you want it layed. If you want a slight slope at the end or if you want it completely level<br>
If you want a slight slope you have 2 options, you can either extend it out  little or you can make <br>
the end of the area you already measured for the slope.<br>
